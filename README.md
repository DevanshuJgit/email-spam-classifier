# email-spam-classifier
This project is a machine learning model that detects whether an email is spam or not. I trained the model on a labeled dataset of real emails using techniques like text vectorization (TF-IDF) and classifiers like Naive Bayes. This helps automatically filter out unwanted emails and improve inbox safety.
